## My camper van

This project is about my camper van which I have created using different propertise. 

## About 

The object is a camper van og tiny home, and has a number plate (numbers) which is an unique unumber to identify the object. The color (string) is blue. 

The brand (string) is Volkswagen and the model (string) is Caravelle T3. The object had 4 numbers of wheels (numbers). 

The year (number) the car was build was in 1986, which means it is old (boolean). 


Since it is an old car it needs service (array) every second year. The function is printing the services.
